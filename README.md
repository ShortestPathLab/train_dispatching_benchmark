## Repository Organisation

The repository is organized into the following directories:

- `data`:The datasets used in the paper, see [README.md](data/README.md) for more details.
- `model`: All (partial) MiniZinc model files, see [README.md](model/README.md) for more details.
- `raw_results`: Results of individual runs of each solve call made by the experiment scripts (not tracked by git).
- `results`: Aggregated results of the experiments.
- `scripts`: Scripts for running experiments and generating results, see [README.md](scripts/README.md) for more details.
