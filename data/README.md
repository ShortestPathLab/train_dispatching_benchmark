Datasets
========

Currently, all datasets only contain the DataZinc file (extension `dzn`) for the
MiniZinc model. We may add the PDDL+ data files for the planning approach in a 
later stage.

The dataset `icaps21` originated from the paper *"In-Station Train Dispatching: A
PDDL+ Planning Approach"* published at [ICAPS 2021](http://icaps21.icaps-conference.org/home/).
The original files are available at [PDDL+ data files](https://github.com/matteocarde/icaps2021).

The dataset `cp25` were created specifically for the paper.
